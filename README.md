# This code demonstrates the use of virtual function.

I wrote this practice code to achieve some clarity on the concept of virtual functions in C++ and their use in polymorphism while learning the concept from learncpp.com.

Virtual functions are used in C++ function to achieve run time polymorphism. To describe it succinctly, if there is a base class pointer to a derived class object, virtual functions can be used to access the derived class implementation using the base class pointer.

This code attempts to find out how polymorphism works at multiple levels of inheritance.
